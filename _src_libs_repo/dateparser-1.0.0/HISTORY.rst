0.7.0 (2018-02-08)
------------------

Features added during Google Summer of Code 2017:

* Harvesting language data from Unicode CLDR database (https://github.com/unicode-cldr/cldr-json), which includes over 200 locales (#321) - authored by Sarthak Maddan.
  See full currently supported locale list in README.
* Extracting dates from longer strings of text (#324) - authored by Elena Zakharova.
  Special thanks for their awesome contributions!


New features:

* Added (independently from CLDR) Georgian (#308) and Swedish (#305)

Improvements:

* Improved support of Chinese (#359), Thai (#345), French (#301, #304), Russian (#302)
* Removed ruamel.yaml from dependencies (#374). This should reduce the number of installation issues and improve performance as the result of moving away from YAML as basic data storage format.
  Note that YAML is still used as format for support language files.
* Improved performance through using pre-compiling frequent regexes and lazy loading of data (#293, #294, #295, #315)
* Extended tests (#316, #317, #318, #323)
